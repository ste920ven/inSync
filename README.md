##Known Issues
1. Select from URL
  + You must first have selected something from the server before being able to select with a URL. 
  Otherwise you get kicked out of the room but everyone else in the room recieves the music. 
  Once you have selected from the server, you can select as many URLs until you refresh the page. 
  + Temp Solution:
     + 'notasong.mp3' has been added to the server for your convienence of selecting something arbitrary from the server.
  
  + Selecting from URL is not very compatible with mobile
  
2. Audio Player Loading Issues
  + The html5 audio player tends to 'blacked-out' and become unclickable when multiple users are accessing the same mp3 src.
    The first person to log into the room usually has a functioning player while every subsequent login is blacked-out.
  + Temp Solution:
     + If the people without blacked-out players press play and then pause again, everyone else's player becomes un-blacked
     + Alternatively, the host can just toggle play/pause twice to hopefully get everyones player un-blacked
     + Once everyone in the room has a functioning player (the slider should be one color: gray), the host can reset and afterwards everything will work

3. Connected Users Panel
   + No way of knowing when a user leaves so users in that panel will stay there forever [hack: in the js console, run clearUsers('<room name>') to clear all users from that room
